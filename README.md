This repository includes three different projects and my resume.

## 2019 Pennsylvania Census Analysis: Internet and Broadband

I created this project on my own to discover how income level affects a person's access to the internet. To come to my conclusions, I did the following:
* Searched for lastest available census data that contained the data I needed. Found this data in the United States Census Bureau's 2019 American Community Survey (ACS).
* Selected a subset of categories from the ACS confined to the state of Pennsylvania.
* Downloaded the data in JSON since CSV downloads failed to work.
* Used regular expressions to change JSON structure to CSV format.
* Imported in Excel. Added new columns as necessary to facilitate pivot table creation.
* Filtered the data as necessary to remove any records that would have skewed the results.
* Created presentation of results (tables and charts) in new sheet.
