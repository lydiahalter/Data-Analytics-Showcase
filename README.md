## 2019 Pennsylvania Census Analysis: Internet and Broadband

I created this project on my own to discover how income level affects a person's access to the internet. To come to my conclusions, I did the following:
1. Searched for lastest available census data that contained the data I needed. Found this data in the United States Census Bureau's [2019 American Community Survey (ACS)](https://data.census.gov/mdat/#/search?ds=ACSPUMS1Y2019&vv=WKHP,GRPIP,*HINCP&cv=HISPEED,ACCESS&rv=ucgid,WIF,MAR&wt=WGTP&g=0400000US42).
2. Selected a subset of categories from the ACS confined to the state of Pennsylvania.
3. Downloaded the data in JSON since CSV downloads failed to work.
4. Used regular expressions to change JSON structure to CSV format.
5. Imported in Excel. Added new columns as necessary to facilitate pivot table creation.
6. Filtered the data as necessary to remove any records that would have skewed the results.
7. Created presentation of results (tables and charts) in new sheet.
